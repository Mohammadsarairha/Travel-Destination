# Travel-Destination (React APP)
## Steps to create React app

1- Initialize a new npm project (npm init -y)

2- Install the react dependencies to your project (npm i react react-dom react-scripts)

3- Add in `package.json` file ( scripts":{"start": "react-scripts start"} )

4- Create folder name it public and create a basic `index.html` template and add a "div" tag with "id='root" in the body.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
  <meta charset="UTF-8">
  <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge">
  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
  <title>Document</title>
</head>
<body>
  <div id="root"></div>
</body>
</html>
```

5- Create folder name it "src" and create `index.js` and add the following 
```js
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';
import App from './App';
ReactDOM.render(<App />, document.getElementById('root'));
```

6- In src create `App.jsx` file and add a basic function component
```js
import React from 'react';
export default function App() {
  return (
    <div>
      <p>Hello Pizza üçï World üëã</p>
    </div>
  )
}
```

7- Back in your terminal make sure you are in the root of your project. Type `tree -I node_modules` and you should see the following:
```bash
‚ûú  project-name tree -I node_modules
.
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ package.json
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ package-lock.json
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ public
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ index.html
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ src
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ App.jsx
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ index.js
```

8- To test the project run the following command

```bash
npm start
```
- If you are running the project for the first time, you will be promoted this message

```bash
> project-name@1.0.0 start
> react-scripts start

Would you like to add the defaults to your package.json? ‚Ä∫ (Y/n)
```
- answer with `y` for yes.
9- If you set up everything according to the cheat sheet you should be seeing this in your terminal
```bash
